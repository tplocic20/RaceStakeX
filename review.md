TL;DR;
To be honest, this is a mess. Maybe I should not say that so openly, but the better result would be done by vibe coding and usage of Calude or Cursor.
If it was my decision - I would start it from scratch, using something more modern like Next.js, tailwind and proper components library (I didn't even touch the SEO topics, which will be completely not existing)

The whole codebase looks like done by a junior dev that has no idea what he is doing. It looks like done in 2010 after watching react.js 101 tutorial.

## Code Duplication Issues

### 1. Ridiculous Component Duplication

**Problem:** Entire component structure duplicated between `/landingcomponents` and `/iphonecomponents`

**Examples:**

- `Partners.js` exists in both folders with 95% identical code
- `IContent1.js` vs `Munityhub.js` - essentially the same component
- All 13 landing components have mobile duplicates

**Mess it creates:**

- Maintenance nightmare - any change needs to be done twice
- Increased bundle size - couple be avoided with lazy loading - but it's just patch, not a solution
- Inconsistent behavior between desktop/mobile

### 2. CSS Duplication and naming

**Problem:** Similar styles repeated across 20+ CSS files, this could be avoided simply by usig tailwindcss. Also, named are not self explanatory making it hard to understand what it's happening there

**Examples:**

```css
/* Repeated in multiple files */
.title {
  font-family: RNS Sanz;
  font-size: 32px;
  font-weight: 900;
  line-height: 38px;
  letter-spacing: 0em;
}

/* Same gradients defined everywhere */
background: radial-gradient(circle at right, #203342, transparent 300px);
```

**Mess it creates:**

- No design consistency
- Simple usage of the css variables could help minimase this mess - with this code it's nearly impossible to make consistend changes
- Difficult to maintain brand colors
- Large CSS bundle sizes
- No theming capabilities

### 3. Image Import duplication

**Problem:** 26+ images imported individually across multiple files

**Example:**

```javascript
// Repeated in Partners.js and IContent8.js
import Partner1Img from "../images/Partner1.png";
import Partner2Img from "../images/Partner2.png";
// ... 24 more identical imports
```

**Mess it creates:**

- Bundle bloat
- No lazy loading
- Maintenance overhead
- Poor performance

---

## Poor responsiveness (and we all know it's the key)

### 1. Desktop-First approach - that went wrong

**Problem:** Separate mobile components instead of responsive design

**Evidence:**

- `/iphonecomponents` folder with duplicated components
- No fluid responsive design patterns
- Mobile treated as separate application

### 2. No Real Responsive Design

**Problem:** Fixed pixel values and minimal breakpoints

**Examples:**

```css
/* Fixed widths everywhere, also pointless css variable */
.slider {
  --slide-size: 380px;
  width: var(--slide-size);
}

/* Limited breakpoints */
@media screen and (max-width: 1280px) {
  /* Only desktop adjustments */
}
```

**Mess it creates:**

- Poor tablet experience
- No fluid scaling
- Maintenance of two codebases

---

## Architecture...

### 1. No Component Library/Design System

- Lack of modern UI libraries - for example Radix UI
- No Tailwind CSS or anything helping with styles
- Component patterns, slots, whatever there is - that was not used

**Current State:**

```
❌ Current Structure:
/landingcomponents - 20+ files
/iphonecomponents - 10+ files (duplicates)
Each component has its own CSS file
```

### 2. Poor File Organization

**Current Issues:**

- 30+ component files in flat structure
- No separation of contexts...
- Business logic mixed with presentation
- Next to no reusable utilities

---

## Security Issues

### 1. Hardcoded keys

**Critical Vulnerability:** Sensitive keys exposed in client-side code

**Location:** `src/utils/constants.js````

## No modern development practices - aka 2010 vibes

### 1. Lack of component composition

**Problems:**

- Large monolithic components (500+ lines)
- Bad component naming
- Poor reusability

**Example of Current Approach:**

```jsx
// ❌ Monolithic component
export const Games = () => {
  return <div className="Games">{/* 200+ lines of JSX */}</div>;
};
```

**Better Approach:**

```jsx
// ✅ Composable components
<Section>
  <Section.Header>
    <Title>GAMES & DAPPS</Title>
  </Section.Header>
  <Section.Content>
    <GameGrid>
      <GameCard {...game1} />
      <GameCard {...game2} />
    </GameGrid>
  </Section.Content>
</Section>
```

### 2. No performance optimization

**Missing:**

- No memoization
- Lazy loading for images and components
- Code splitting for routes
- Bundle optimization

**Mess it creates:**

- Large initial bundle size
- Poor loading performance
- Unnecessary re-renders

### 3. No TypeScript

**Problems:**

- Missing type safety
- Prone to runtime errors
- Poor developer experience
- No autocomplete/IntelliSense
